    supportingText: "Esther was a beautiful queen who stepped out in faith, trusting in God and because of her bravery the lives of thousands of people were saved. Following the call that God has on your life is not just about serving others it is also about living as the person God intended you to be. I genuinely believed that I didn’t have any gifts. Esther didn’t believe in herself either and it took someone else to prompt her to discover her calling. So Esther Ministry was founded to provide a practical way to discover your true gifts and skills and put them into action for God."
