                supportingParagraph: "As the wife of a vicar, I have experienced the huge pressure, privilege and lonliness that can be ministry life; with this in mind, I felt prompted to create an Esther day exclusively for partners of church leaders. I feel so passionately that if the other halves of church leaders are prepared, loved, supported and know what God is calling THEM to as well, then we will have stronger marriages, stronger parishes and stronger God-filled communities. Are you the spouse of a Church leader, Ordinand or Curate? Would you benefit from a day to discern your calling in all of this? Would you like support to prepare for ministry life or transition within ministry life? This one day course has been prepared exclusively for you, based on my journey and the epic fails, lonliness and joy I have faced so far. The course will help you discern who you are in Him, what your gifts are in this season and how you can operate within them."
